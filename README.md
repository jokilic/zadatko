# Zadatko ðŸ“‹

ðŸ“‹ **Zadatko** is a simple task management application written in **Flutter**.

### Signup/Login

Tasks are stored in a **Firebase** database.\
When first opening the app, you will sign-up with an email & password so the tasks are linked with your account.\
If you throw your phone in the water or simply decide to get a new one, tasks will always wait for you to check them off.\
Just login with your credentials and get to working.

### Tags

Tasks can be linked with tags so you can group everything together.\
You can create a tag and put a fancy color on it.\
That way, tasks are much easier to handle and get done in a timely manner.

### Update

Tasks and tags can both be updated after they've been created.\
Just hold the task or tag and modify anything your heart desires.\
Everything gets seamlessly updated in the database.

### Delete

When you're done with the task, you can check it off or you can delete it altogether.\
Everything is flexible and easy to use.

**Thank you for using my task management app.**
