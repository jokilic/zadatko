# Zadatko

**Zadatko** will be a simple application that offers the users to write their tasks, check them off, add tags on them and possibly more funcionality.

I'm creating it with **Flutter** & **Firebase**.
The users will need to login using their email & password.
Tasks will be stored in the cloud and they will be safe, even if the app gets uninstalled.

I'm making this app because I want to work with **Firebase**.

## Current state of the app

The app is in very early development.
I have created a Firebase database, everything is connected with the app.
I have created the Login/Signup screen, but that's where everything stops.

### This is on GitHub because I wanted to show the progress to my friend .
